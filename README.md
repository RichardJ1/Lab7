1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, to ensure that the centralized code repository is always working, without needing to rely on developers to remember to run tests locally.
2. No. That's what Unit Tests are for.
3. Navigation preforms the testing after reloading a page, but snapshot analyzes it from a very specific point. This can be used to assess a specific state rather than the first view after reload.
4. Improvements: 
    - Size images properly
    - Use a new-gen format for the images
    - Preconnect to required origin so that page load is faster
    - Include a meta viewport tag including width and initial-scale
